    "### Exercise Description\n",
    "In this practical exercise, our goal is to explore the different ways we can trigger workflows in GitHub Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the instructions for the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file named `02-workflow-events.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name the workflow `02 - Workflow Events`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the following triggers to your workflow:\n",
    "    a. `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a single job to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The job, named `echo`, should run on `ubuntu-latest` and contain a single step, named `Show the trigger`, which prints the type of the name of the event that triggered the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now add more triggers to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. `pull_request`\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. `schedule` cron expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. `workflow_dispatch`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the different ways the workflow is triggered.\n",
    "    a. You can create a pull request on GitHub to see how this changes the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "    b. Also give it a try to trigger it from the UI. To do so \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Click under the \"Actions\" tab in the home page of the repository.\n",
    "      - Select the workflow named `02 - Workflow Events` on the left of the screen.\n",
    "      - Click on the \"Run workflow\" button on the right side of the screen, next to the message \"This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger.\"\n",

    "#### Using a valid cron syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this recording, GitHub Actions does not support cron job definitions containing six elements (for example, `'0 0 * * * *'`), only definitions containing five elements. Check the resources section of this lecture for a cron generator that uses the valid syntax.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Generate a React application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Create a new folder named `04-using-actions` at the root of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Using a terminal, cd into this directory and scaffold a React application inside a `react-app` directory. You can either create the directory\n",

    "\n",
    "    d. Take a few moments to inspect the files and get familiar with the application folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the first version of the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Create a file named `04-using-actions.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder at the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Name the `workflow 04 - Using Actions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Add the following triggers to your workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -  `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Add a single job named `build` to the workflow. The job should contain two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. The first one, named `Checkout Code`, should checkout the repository code into the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. The second one, named `Printing Folders`, should simply print the folder structure after the checkout command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Commit the changes and push the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    f. Take a few moments to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend the workflow to setup node and install the dependencies of the React application\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Remove the `Printing Folders` step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Add a new step after the `Checkout Code` step. This new step should be named `Setup Node` and setup node using the `20.x` version.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Add a new step after the `Setup Node` step. This new step should be named `Install Dependencies` install the dependencies of our React application by running the `npm ci` command inside the React application folder. You can either `cd` into the directory before running the `npm ci` command, or you can pass the working directory by adding a `working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app` option to the step (as a sibling key to `name` and `run`).\n",

    "    d. Commit the changes and push the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Take a few moments to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extend the workflow to execute the automated tests from the React application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Add a new step after the `Install Dependencies` step. This new step should be named Run Unit Tests and it should execute the automated tests by running the npm run test command inside the React application folder. You can either `cd` into the directory before running the `npm run test` command, or you can pass the working directory by adding a `working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app` option to the step (as a sibling key to `name` and `run`).\n",

    "#### Using third-party actions in GitHub Actions Workflows\n",
    "\n",

    "    d. Add a single job to the workflow. The job, named `echo-data`, should run on `ubuntu-latest` and contain two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.  The first step, named `Display Information`, should print the following lines containing information from the `github` context (tip: use a multi-line script with several `echo commands`):\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. `\"Event name: <retrieve the event name here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. `\"Ref: <retrieve the ref here>\"`\n",

    "\n",
    "2. Extending the workflow with invalid contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Now add a new configuration key named `run-name` to the workflow. This is defined at the top-level, as a sibling to the `name` and `on` keys. The run-name allows you to define the name of the workflow run that appears on the UI.\n",

    "    d. Now trigger the workflow from the UI and try it with different variations for the `debug` input. How does this impact the result of the workflow runs?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extending the workflow with the env context:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Add a top-level `env` key to define two environment variables:\n",

    "\n",
    "    ii. `MY_OVERWRITTEN_VAR`, with the value set to `'job'`\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Add an additional step after the `Retrieve Variable` step, and name it `Print Env Variables`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Under the `Print Env Variables`, add an `env` key to define a single environment variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. `MY_OVERWRITTEN_VAR`, with the value set to `'step'`\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Execute a multi-line script to print the following information on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. `\"Workflow env: <retrieve the value of the MY_WORKFLOW_VAR env variable here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. `\"Overwritten env: <retrieve the value of the MY_OVERWRITTEN_VAR env variable here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    f. Add yet another step after the first Print Env Variables. You can name the step similarly to the previous one. Do not define any additional env variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "    g. Execute a multi-line script to print the following information on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. `\"Workflow env: <retrieve the value of the MY_WORKFLOW_VAR env variable here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. `\"Overwritten env: <retrieve the value of the MY_OVERWRITTEN_VAR env variable here>\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "    h. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the output of the workflow run. How were the `env` variables overwritten regarding the workflow, job, and step hierarchy?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. After exploring the different ways to trigger a workflow, reduce the list of triggers to leave only `workflow_dispatch` to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs.\n",

    "1. Create a file named `07-expressions.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder at the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name the workflow `07 - Using Expressions`.\n",

    "3. Add the following triggers with event filters and activity types to your workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "  b. `workflow_dispatch`: under the `workflow_dispatch` event trigger, define one input named `debug`, of type `boolean`, and with a default value of `false`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a single job named `echo` to the workflow. The job should run on `ubuntu-latest` and should contain three steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "  a. The first step, named `[debug] Print start-up data,` should execute only if the `inputs.debug` input is set to `true`. If you are unsure how to do it, check the Tips section below. The step should run a multi-line script to print the following data:\n",
