    "- Jobs also define in which execution environment they will run(example linux windows or mac)\n",
    "- Jobs are composed of one or more steps.\n",
    "- by default jobs are run in parallel(example if you have five jobs and you do not specify any dependency between these jobs , they will all start at same time\n",

    "    b. `workflow_dispatch`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add two jobs to the workflow\n",

    "## Practical Exercise 02 - Using Different Events to Trigger Workflows\n",
    "### Exercise Description\n",
    "In this practical exercise, our goal is to explore the different ways we can trigger workflows in GitHub Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the instructions for the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file named `02-workflow-events.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name the workflow `02 - Workflow Events`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the following triggers to your workflow:\n",
    "    a. `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a single job to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The job, named `echo`, should run on `ubuntu-latest` and contain a single step, named `Show the trigger`, which prints the type of the name of the event that triggered the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now add more triggers to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. `pull_request`\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. `schedule` cron expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. `workflow_dispatch`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the different ways the workflow is triggered.\n",
    "    a. You can create a pull request on GitHub to see how this changes the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "    b. Also give it a try to trigger it from the UI. To do so \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Click under the \"Actions\" tab in the home page of the repository.\n",
    "      - Select the workflow named `02 - Workflow Events` on the left of the screen.\n",
    "      - Click on the \"Run workflow\" button on the right side of the screen, next to the message \"This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After exploring the different ways to trigger a workflow, reduce the list of triggers to leave only workflow_dispatch to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "#### Using a valid cron syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this recording, GitHub Actions does not support cron job definitions containing six elements (for example, `'0 0 * * * *'`), only definitions containing five elements. Check the resources section of this lecture for a cron generator that uses the valid syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a trigger using cron, you should use the following syntax:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "    - cron: '<cron expression>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Accessing the name of the event that triggered the workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the name of the event triggering the workflow, you can use the following special syntax: ${{ github.event_name }}. For example:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "steps:\n",
    "  - name: Event name\n",
    "    run: |\n",

    "In this practical exercise, our goal is to explore how we can use third-party custom actions to perform tasks without having to define them from scratch.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Generate a React application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Create a new folder named `04-using-actions` at the root of the repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Using a terminal, cd into this directory and scaffold a React application inside a `react-app` directory. You can either create the directory\n",

    "\n",
    "    c. Once the React setup is done, you should see a success message.\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Take a few moments to inspect the files and get familiar with the application folder structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create the first version of the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Create a file named `04-using-actions.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder at the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Name the `workflow 04 - Using Actions`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Add the following triggers to your workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "        -  `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Add a single job named `build` to the workflow. The job should contain two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    i. The first one, named `Checkout Code`, should checkout the repository code into the current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "    ii. The second one, named `Printing Folders`, should simply print the folder structure after the checkout command.\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Commit the changes and push the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    f. Take a few moments to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Extend the workflow to setup node and install the dependencies of the React application\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Remove the `Printing Folders` step.\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. Add a new step after the `Checkout Code` step. This new step should be named `Setup Node` and setup node using the `20.x` version.\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. Add a new step after the `Setup Node` step. This new step should be named `Install Dependencies` install the dependencies of our React application by running the `npm ci` command inside the React application folder. You can either `cd` into the directory before running the `npm ci` command, or you can pass the working directory by adding a `working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app` option to the step (as a sibling key to `name` and `run`).\n",
    "\n",
    "    d. Commit the changes and push the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "    e. Take a few moments to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Extend the workflow to execute the automated tests from the React application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. Add a new step after the `Install Dependencies` step. This new step should be named Run Unit Tests and it should execute the automated tests by running the npm run test command inside the React application folder. You can either `cd` into the directory before running the `npm run test` command, or you can pass the working directory by adding a `working-directory: 04-using-actions/react-app` option to the step (as a sibling key to `name` and `run`).\n",

    "### Tips\n",
    "#### Scaffolding a React application with create-react-app\n",

    "To generate a React application with a single command, you can leverage the create-react-app utility. In order to do that, simply run the following inside the `04-using-actions folder: npx create-react-app --template typescript react-app`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Using third-party actions in GitHub Actions Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax to leverage a third-party action is very simple. Instead of using the run key and defining a shell script, you should use the uses key and pass the name and the version of the action you wish to use. Here is an example of the syntax:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. `actions/checkout@v4`: used to checkout the repository code into the working directory of the workflow run. Without this, we cannot work with the code from our repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `actions/setup-node@v4`: used to setup node with a specific version, as well as any other necessary dependencies. To provide a specific version of Node to be setup, you can use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "steps:\n",
    "  - name: Setup Node\n",
    "    uses: actions/setup-node@v4\n",
