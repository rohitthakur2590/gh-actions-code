    "### Jobs\n",
    "- Jobs are then defined at the workflow level and can't be created outside of workflow levels\n",
    "- Jobs also define in which execution environment they will run(example linux windows or mac)\n",
    "- Jobs are composed of one or more steps.\n",
    "- by default jobs are run in parallel(example if you have five jobs and you do not specify any dependency between these jobs , they will all start at same time\n",

    "- Steps are defined at the job level.\n",
    "- Steps define the actual script or GitHub Action that will be executed onces that step is run.\n",

    "2. Name the workflow `01 - Building Blocks`\n",
    "3. Add the following trigger to your workflow:\n",
    "    a. `push`\n",
    "    b. `workflow_dispatch`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add two jobs to the workflow\n",

    "    b. The second job, `echo-goodbye`, should also run on the `ubuntu-latest` and have two steps:\n",
    "    \n",
    "        i.  The first step named `Failed step`, should run a multiline bash script which prints \"I will fail\" on the screen and exits with any non-zero code.\n",
    "        ii. The second step, named `Say goodbye`, should simply print `\"Goodbye!\"` on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Take some time to play around and inspect what happens once a step fails during the workflow execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. As a last step, change the first step of the second job to exit with a zero code. You can also adjust the name of the step and the printed message to match the new state.\n",
    "\n",
    "Have a look at how this impacts the workflow execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Change the workflow triggers to contain only `workflow_dispatch` to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs."

    "## Practical Exercise 02 - Using Different Events to Trigger Workflows\n",
    "### Exercise Description\n",
    "In this practical exercise, our goal is to explore the different ways we can trigger workflows in GitHub Actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the instructions for the exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a file named `02-workflow-events.yaml` under the `.github/workflows` folder in the root of your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Name the workflow `02 - Workflow Events`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Add the following triggers to your workflow:\n",
    "    a. `push`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Add a single job to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. The job, named `echo`, should run on `ubuntu-latest` and contain a single step, named `Show the trigger`, which prints the type of the name of the event that triggered the workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Now add more triggers to the workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "    a. `pull_request`\n",
    "\n",
    "    b. `schedule` cron expression\n",
    "\n",
    "    c. `workflow_dispatch`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Commit the changes and push the code. Take some time to inspect the different ways the workflow is triggered.\n",
    "    a. You can create a pull request on GitHub to see how this changes the output of the workflow run.\n",
    "    b. Also give it a try to trigger it from the UI. To do so \n",
    "\n",
    "      - Click under the \"Actions\" tab in the home page of the repository.\n",
    "      - Select the workflow named `02 - Workflow Events` on the left of the screen.\n",
    "      - Click on the \"Run workflow\" button on the right side of the screen, next to the message \"This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After exploring the different ways to trigger a workflow, reduce the list of triggers to leave only workflow_dispatch to prevent this workflow from running with every push and pollute the list of workflow runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tips\n",
    "#### Using a valid cron syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "At the time of this recording, GitHub Actions does not support cron job definitions containing six elements (for example, `'0 0 * * * *'`), only definitions containing five elements. Check the resources section of this lecture for a cron generator that uses the valid syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define a trigger using cron, you should use the following syntax:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "on:\n",
    "  schedule:\n",
    "    - cron: '<cron expression>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Accessing the name of the event that triggered the workflow**\n",
    "\n",
    "To access the name of the event triggering the workflow, you can use the following special syntax: ${{ github.event_name }}. For example:\n",
    "```yaml\n",
    "steps:\n",
    "  - name: Event name\n",
    "    run: |\n",
    "      echo \"Event name: ${{ github.event_name }}\"\n",

    "## Workflow Runners\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can think of workflow runners as virtual servers, so vms that actually execute jobs from workflows.\n",
